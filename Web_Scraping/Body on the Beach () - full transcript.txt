Annie didn't feel lonely.
Even if she was alone, she was
independent, she was strong.
She wanted to explore new things
in life, do something new.
If she wanted to do something,
she did it.
I remember Annie as a very happy,
very lively girl.
She enjoyed music,
she enjoyed dancing.
With her long, thick blonde hair,
she was like a Viking princess.
She was a great friend,
taken from us too soon.
This programme contains some scenes
which some viewers may find upsetting
and deals with Suicide.
I was just walking along
Prestwick Beach.
When I got to about the curve
coming up here,
I looked over and she was lying
head in against the wall.
She wanted to come back to Sweden.
PHONE RINGS
Then this terrible phone call -
Annie had been found dead.
15:14 is the first sighting of her
and she's on her own.
When she comes back into the airport
she looks distressed. What happened?
She was in a good mood.
She didn't seem depressed at all.
It doesn't add up.
There was nothing to indicate that I
was dealing with a potential murder.
Now, if what the family
is saying is true,
then you're talking about
a potential cover up.
Obviously, there's ways and means
of deleting phone records.
People who can do that
are the security services.
We want to know the truth,
whatever it is.
My dad's from this part of Scotland.
My granny used to stay
just up there.
I've got tonnes of happy memories
here.
But now I've got a different
association with this place.
This is the spot right here
where Annie's body was discovered
on a winter's morning.
I was only 13 when Annie died
but the story of her death
has always stayed with me.
We all know that when terrible
things happen to women,
sometimes their stories
just aren't taken seriously
by the people that are supposed
to be looking after them.
And even though Annie died
18 years ago,
it feels like a story
we could have heard yesterday.
And many people, her friends
and family included,
believe that Annie
was actually murdered.
The question is, though,
could they be right?
I want to find out what
really happened to Annie.
And the best place to start
is the day she was found
right here on this beach.
TICKING
It's a Sunday morning, you've
got a report of a female body
having been discovered
on Prestwick Beach.
My name is Michael Neill
and my connection with
the Annie Borjesson case was
I was the detective on duty
the morning Annie's body
was discovered.
You've got a young female
who's dead on the beach.
To err on the side of caution
it was treated as a crime scene.
The crime scene manager attended,
along with scenes of crime officers,
who were going to photograph it, but
we were in a race against time here
to get Annie's body off the beach
before the tide was upon us.
A bag was sitting beside her,
her jacket was beside her.
Her wallet was still there,
her passport was still there.
Annie was a Swedish
foreign national.
We contacted the Swedish
police authorities
to pass on a death message.
Annie was my best friend.
She had told me that she was going
to come home to Sweden to visit me
and stay at my house
for a couple of days.
And she had great plans
what she wanted to do.
My son was preparing his room
for her to be able to have.
PHONE RINGS
Then this terrible phone call came.
I thought it was Annie and I was
so happy running to the phone.
And then I heard her sister's voice
and I was...
..shocked to hear
Annie had been found dead.
PHONE RINGS
Her mother called me
and told the tragic
that had happened in Scotland.
That day and some days after
were not so funny.
Erm...
It isn't fair.
It's a cruel world we're living in.
One of the things I've done
a lot as a journalist
is spend time tracking down material
like documents, reports and photos
that can help get to the truth
in a case like this.
It's not the most glamorous
part of the job,
but it sometimes gets the results.
This is a document that I've tracked
down from the Swedish authorities.
Now, it is in Swedish,
but I've had it translated,
and what it says is that Annie
Borjesson was found drowned
in the water at Prestwick and that
the Scottish police suspect suicide.
But you need to take
a look at the date.
This letter is from
December 5th, 2005.
That's only one day after
Annie's body was discovered,
so, if you think about it,
there's been no postmortem,
there's been no investigation
into her death,
yet the Scottish police are already
telling the Swedish authorities
that they suspect suicide.
When the Scottish police
said suicide,
it was a devastating time.
And first thoughts was,
no, this must be a mistake.
Not Annie.
The Scottish police said it was
a suicide just within some hours.
But what I know her for...
..20 years or something like that,
no, definitely not.
I've managed to get my hands
on Annie's postmortem.
There's loads of details in it
and some of them are pretty graphic.
Now, I'm not an expert
on this kind of stuff,
and I could use some help
in understanding it.
This is the guy.
Now, he seems to have literally
written the book
on death by drowning.
I'm Dr Stuart Hamilton.
I'm a Home Office-registered
forensic pathologist.
I've got 14 years of experience
of suspicious deaths and murders.
And I'm one of the co-authors
of the guidelines
on autopsies in drowning.
It is the most detailed
medical examination
a human being will ever undergo.
And with that comes
an immense responsibility.
In Annie's case, there are no
significant injuries present.
There's no evidence of trauma.
The vast majority of the examination
is recorded as normal.
The doctor concludes that
death was due to drowning.
Having read that report,
I would agree that she has drowned,
but as a forensic pathologist,
that raises the question
of how she came to drown.
Any time the police are asked
about Annie's case,
they insist that they did it all
right,
so you'd think that they'd be
happy to talk about it, right?
But we have contacted a dozen police
officers involved in this case
and pretty much nobody
wants to speak about it.
But one man who is prepared to
is retired detective Mick Neill.
He wasn't in charge
of the investigation
but he is willing to talk
about his role.
As part of the investigation,
a timeline was established
to try and get a picture
of what's happened
leading up to Annie's death
on the beach that day.
We reviewed hours and hours
of CCTV at Prestwick Airport
and eventually got her on the
walkway over into the airport.
She was alone.
We lose her out of camera,
then she appears back,
goes out one of the doors
for a matter of minutes,
and then comes back in,
comes back across the walkway,
still alone...
..and then she goes out
of the airport.
She's seen heading down
towards the beach area.
It's so common when people
take their own life
that it's a snap decision,
a decision that's made in a second,
and that changes everybody's life
around about them.
Now, that is definitely Annie,
there.
You know, she's got her passport
on her,
but instead of catching
that flight back home,
police believe that Annie then
left the airport,
walks to the beach
and drowns herself.
But is that credible
and does it fit with the evidence?
It looked someone had pressed
their thumbs
standing in front of Annie,
and with matching finger bruises
on her back, like someone had hold
her, grabbed her, around the throat.
The family saw
this big, big bruising
from the temple, over her nose
and down to her cheek.
It was a huge bruising.
All these are not mentioned
in the Scottish autopsy.
We got angry, upset, devastated.
I think that something very
terrible happened to Annie.
Annie was murdered.
CAMERA CLICKING
Now, if what the family
is saying is true,
then the implications of this
are massive.
I mean, you're talking about
a botched police investigation
and you're talking about
a potential cover up.
I mean, those allegations
are just huge
but could it actually be true?
I mean, how likely is it really
that Annie's body
was discovered with the injuries
that the family describe?
Could they be mistaken?
Well, I've dug a little deeper
and I've found evidence
that on her way back home to Sweden,
Annie's body was handled by
another undertaker in London.
I've got my hands on this letter
from the person who picked
Annie's body up.
"The deceased was collected
from the hospital mortuary
"and her condition
was extremely poor.
"In respect to her bruises,
I can verify that she did have
"significant bruising to her body,
which, for reasons I cannot explain,
"I believe were not included
in the autopsy report.
"I find this to be quite unusual
"considering the circumstances
of her death."
Now, this is really significant
because it means that
two separate undertakers
in two different countries
think that the marks
that they saw on Annie's body
were bruises.
So it does seem like there
were marks on her body
but I wonder what they were.
What creates a bruise is damage
to the small blood vessels
just under the skin and they leak.
The pressure in your blood vessels
from your heart beating
pushes the blood into the tissue
around the damaged vessels
and that produces a bruise.
Dead people do not bruise.
So what I have here is a photograph
that the family took
when Annie was repatriated
to Sweden.
There's a limited view
but there is certainly bluish
discoloration around the face.
And particularly down
onto the cheek,
there is a more dense,
purplish-type discoloration.
I have to say that simply
looking at this,
it looks like a bruise.
A bruise is blunt trauma.
It's not recorded in
the first postmortem report.
I would have expected that
to be recorded and it's not,
and that needs to be explained.
There's pretty convincing evidence
that the family are right
when they say the marks
on Annie's body were bruises.
But there's one piece of
evidence
which could determine once and
for all whether that's the case.
Look here. It turns out that
during Annie's postmortem,
multiple photographs are taken by
a police photographer at the time.
Now, these photos could
hold the answer,
so I've submitted a Freedom of
Information request for the photos
taken during Annie's postmortem,
which should take a few weeks
to get a response.
But hopefully soon we can start
to get some answers.
One shock led to another.
The family started to clean her
and prepare her for her own clothes.
Afterwards, Gun phone me.
When she told me about that
the hair had been hacked off,
it felt so wrong, so bad.
Somebody had desecrated Annie.
Her hair was a part
of her personality.
I mean, where's the rest
of her 80cm of hair?
At one point, the police, they
said she hacked it off herself.
Depressed people do so.
Annie's family have never accepted
the fact that her death
was classed as a suicide.
A lot of families can't accept
their loved ones have taken
their own life.
There was never anything at all
in the whole investigation
to indicate that there was
any criminality involved
in Annie's death.
So the police were telling
Annie's loved ones
that she could have been depressed
at the time she died,
but she didn't have a history
of depression.
Was she in a state of mind that
might lead her to take her life?
So, what do we know about Annie?
Her full name is Annie
Kristina Borjesson.
She was born near Malmo
in Sweden in 1975.
She's a really talented linguist.
She speaks six languages,
which is pretty unbelievable.
One of the things Annie loves most
in the whole world is music.
She's a music college graduate,
she plays in a band -
Annie and the Wolves.
SONG PLAYS
It's really funny hearing
her voices, isn't it?
This is actually one of the few
recordings of Annie.
SONG PLAYS
My name is Micke Persson.
I'm an old friend of Annie and
her family since the late '80s.
It's nice.
It's nice.
It's strange to hear in some way.
This is how I remember Annie.
The little rock star
and a happy smile.
We had known each other
for many, many years,
and then we had a fling
or what you can call it -
a small, small relationship to
see if we would fit together,
but, no, we didn't, but we were
still really good friends.
Annie could really
look after herself
and she was a strong individual.
Annie didn't take her life.
Definitely not. Not a chance.
So the people who knew Annie
back in Sweden didn't believe
that she was depressed,
but they were hundreds of miles away
and they hadn't seen her for months.
So what about someone, then,
that knew her in Scotland?
I started working at
The Scotch Whisky Experience.
So that's where I met Annie.
I remember Annie as a very happy,
very lively girl.
She wasn't shy in voicing
her opinion about things.
It's very strange to have been one
of the last people that they know
saw Annie and spoke to Annie.
On the Friday I was working
an evening shift,
I sat down in the staffroom,
and there was a knock on the door.
It was Annie just standing there,
smiling. "Hiya"
She was in a good mood.
She didn't seem depressed at all,
she was very happy,
and everything seemed to be
just normal.
Hearing that the police
concluded very quickly
that Annie committed suicide,
it just doesn't add up in my mind.
So we know that the friend
who spoke to Annie
said that she was behaving normally
and she seemed happy.
And this was the day
before she died.
But one of the things that the
police said to Annie's family
was that she could have been
depressed and that might have been
a reason that she cut her hair.
But look here...
This is the last CCTV image
of Annie at Prestwick Airport.
Now, the police say
that this was taken
just a few hours before she died
and you can clearly see that her
hair is all the way down her back.
Is it really credible that Annie
cut off 80cm of her hair
between leaving the airport
and arriving at the beach
just a few hours later?
I need to ask someone
who's qualified to know.
My name is Dr Keri Nixon.
I'm a consultant
forensic psychologist.
I work on a kind of profile of
a suspect, profile of a victim.
The police put forward
a potential explanation
that Annie could have cut her own
hair as an act of self-harm.
Now, there's footage of her at the
airport that shows her hair is long,
so at some point from leaving the
airport to going into the water,
she gets out scissors
and cuts her hair?
I've worked with people in my clinic
who have severe anxiety.
It can include pulling at the hair
and pulling hair out.
It can include taking out
your own eyelashes.
You know, this is a known anxiety
response, particularly in females.
But to apply that to those few hours
at the point that the police say
she's going from the airport
to the beach, it just doesn't
make any sense to me.
I mean, if Annie didn't cut
her hair, then who did?
And why did the police say that
she might have been depressed
in the first place?
There are so many
unanswered questions.
I mean, I wonder how thorough
the police really were,
so to try and find an answer
I want to go back, right back,
and track down the person
who first found Annie's body.
Come on, then.
Typical December. I was just
walking along Prestwick Beach
as normal.
When I got to about the curve
coming up here,
I saw legs.
I looked over
and there was the body.
She was lying head in
against the wall
and legs pointing outwards.
I felt helpless, you know?
There was nothing I could do.
I just slumped down onto the wall
and phoned the police.
Ten minutes and there was
a constable here
and he took all my details and said
that they would get in touch with me
if they needed me.
Never heard from them again.
I thought I would hear something.
I thought, you know,
they would contact me to...
..I don't know, get a bit more
detail and that, but...
It was surprising that they never,
I would say, for me.
The first time I heard about it
again was in the newspaper.
On the day Annie's found dead,
David is the only witness
that the police have,
so why didn't they speak
to him again?
Had they already made up their mind
about what happened to Annie?
When the body is found at 8:30
and it's in the mortuary by 10:10,
which is 20 minutes away,
it seems unlikely that...
..everything that needed to be done
was done forensically.
It's suggesting that the decision
as to what has happened to her
has already been made.
There is not concern
that a third party
could have been involved
in this death.
A young woman found dead outdoors
is always a matter of concern.
It wasn't that it was just assumed
it was suicide and nothing was done.
There was hours and hours
of police work done.
There was nothing to indicate that I
was dealing with a potential murder.
We didn't find anything
because there was nothing to find.
Remember, I've submitted
a Freedom of Information request...
..for the photos taken
during Annie's postmortem
just so that they can be looked at
by an independent expert.
Well, I've just had a response...
..and the answer is no.
And the reason that they've given
for this is that they say
it's not in the public interest
to release these photos.
Now, I'm not the first person
to get a knock-back like this
because time and time again, Annie's
family have requested these photos.
And each time they've been refused
as well.
Now, the authorities say that
the reason for this refusal
is because it's not
in the family's interest...
..even though they're the ones
requesting them.
So it's just like they're
being gaslighted, really.
I don't understand
the decision making around that
and that could be easily rectified.
Just show those photographs.
It makes it look like
there's something to hide.
And that's either poor decision
making or there's something to hide.
She is saying that somebody
is following her,
that somebody is reading her emails.
She's very anxious
and feels threatened.
That's where you start to think,
what is going on here?
You can't do that if you're
a member of the public.
People who can do that, of course,
are the security services.
Why has that been marked
as classified?
When she comes back into the
airport, she looks distressed.
What happened at the airport?
